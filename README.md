# Rolling Sky Edit Archives
These are the unencrypted level files for my Rolling Sky Edits.

To play these levels, I recommend using Rolling Sky Unlocked:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOVFp5pwICQG5swru3-kKigRyowmn5fq
- Put each file to the corresponding folder.
  - Level and End files go to Levels
  - Theme files go to Themes
  - geoBuffer files go to GeoBuffers

Note: These level files are not the final version of the edits.
